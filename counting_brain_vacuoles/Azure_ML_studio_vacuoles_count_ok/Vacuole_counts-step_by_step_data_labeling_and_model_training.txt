1. Create ML labels on Azure ML Studio
- Create workspace
- New -> Data labeling project -> Computer vision -> Object detection
2. Export labels as .json
3. Convert .json to .jsonl file using Python code (json_to_jsonl_conversion.py)
- There's probably a way to load .json generated on Azure ML Studio in the next step directly,
but I don't know how
4. Create data - Table schema
- Under Assets (hamburger menu): Data -> "Tabular" -> Select .jsonl (from local files) -> Select "stream" in image_url (schema section)
5. Submit an automated ML job
- Under Authoring (hamburger menu): Automated ML -> New job
- Under Task type & data: Select data created on step 4
- Under Task settings: Select target column to image_details (DataRow)
!!!Important - For computer vision tasks, a GPU is necessary.
Unfortunately, it seems that no GPUs are easily available in free trial.
Because of that, may need to get a personal/institutional paid subscription.

There are some videos explaining how to use AutoML for object detection tasks - but it is a little cumbersome.

Better idea is just to use Azure ML Studio to label images and create a .json.

Than, run the code ChatGPT helped me create.
