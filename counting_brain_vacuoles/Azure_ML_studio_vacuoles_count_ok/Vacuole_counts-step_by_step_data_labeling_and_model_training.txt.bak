1. Create ML labels on Azure ML Studio
- Create workspace
- New -> Data labeling project -> Computer vision -> Object detection
2. Export labels as .json
3. Convert .json to .jsonl file using Python code (json_to_jsonl_conversion.py)
- There's probably a way to load .json generated on Azure ML Studio in the next step directly,
but I don't know how
4. Create data - Table schema
- Under Assets (hamburger menu): Data -> Load table -> Select .jsonl -> Select "stream" in schema section
5. Submit an automated ML job
- Under Authoring (hamburger menu): Automated ML -> New job
- Under Task type & data: Select data created on step 4
- Under Task settings: Select target column to image_details (DataRow)
!!!Important - For computer vision tasks, a GPU is necessary.
Unfortunately, it seems that no GPUs are easily available in free trial.
Because of that, I changed my task from Computer vision to Classification, and used a standard provisioned CPU instance.
